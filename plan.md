- try interpolation and inversion without PPL
- understand and measure recall
- try different # of style vectors and save images for jeff
- review grads. how in the **** is the gradient on the mapper similar, but not on the style?
- work out convolution baking
- write down the story
- how is their perceptual loss so good?
- try disabling their new ada stuff. Is it saved in the image outputs?
- does stylegan2 still pass minibatch std to the discr?
- review configs 

- why did style mixing cause a memory leak? This may be indicative of an underlying problem... -> I think it's just because of the reshaping, which confuses the version counts
- understand how the minibatches are split on the GPU
